# Catnip

Catin is a plugin for the amazing [Cat](https://github.com/cheshire-cat-ai) :kissing_cat:

Like catnip for cats, this plugin aims to improve the mood of its users through good news from around the world. The news is taken from the New York Times feed, and LLM chooses the more positive ones

I took inspiration from [this awesome plugin](https://github.com/AndreaPesce2002/the-latest-news-in-wonderland)

## Usage

Active the plugin in the plugins tab, and ask the cat for good news!

## Contribute

This is my first plugin for an LLM, and these are my first lines of code in Python. I have a lot to learn, so feel free to contribute to the repository and teach me something useful!

Remember, curiosity is the key to learning! Meow!
