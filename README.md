Like catnip for cats, this plugin aims to improve the mood of its users through good news from around the world.

The news is taken from the New York Times feed and LLM chose the more positive.

## Usage

Active the plugin in the plugins tab, and ask the cat for good news!

## Contribute

This is my first plugin for an LLM, and these are my first python's lines of code. I have to learn a lot!
So feel free to contribute to the repo and teach me something usefull!
